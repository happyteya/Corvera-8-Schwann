Rock, paper, scissors.
The classic rock, paper, and scissors game.
Where in  a player chooses between rock, paper, and scissors.

The game follows the standard rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock) and features player vs. computermode, and random computer moves. 
The project consists of a single Python file (`rock_paper_scissors.py`) with functions for getting player and computer moves, determining the winner, and running the game loop.
To play, simply run `python rock_paper_scissors.py` and follow the in-game prompts.
